# Resume_Parsing
My resume parser application can take in millions of resumes, parse the needed fields and categorise them. This resume parser uses the popular python library - Spacy for OCR and text classifications. First we train our model with these fields, then the application can pick out the values of these fields from new resumes being input.  The dataset of resumes has the following fields:
Location,
Designation,
Name, 
Years of Experience, 
College, 
Degree, 
Graduation Year, 
Companies worked at, 
Email address
